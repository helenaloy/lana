Check-in is done at camp reception, you don't have to worry whether someone will be at home or not, whether we're sleeping or what mood we're in right now. Only you have the keys to the mobile home and we won't come to inspect your room when you're at the beach. ;)\n\nThe AC remote is yours during your stay without extra charge and complaints, and if you use up the batteries let us know and we'll send new ones.\n\nThe mobile home is located in Camp Dalmacija (Privlaka) which has its own sandy beach that you reach by walking through the camp, there are no busy streets that give you headaches. Your little ones can move freely from the house all the way to the sandy beach. After entering the sea, the idyll continues. A long shallow area awaits you, ideal for playing and relaxing, and for lovers of deeper sea - that's also nearby.\n\nParking space is secured in front of the plot and everything is accessible on foot, which means your metal friend can finally rest, because you can do everything you need without it."
